# howtopronounce
a automatic python program to do the following automatically:
- Use TTS to pronounce a word correctly and put it in a mp4
- Using the same video from above, adds a large text to the middle of the video showing the word.
Alike: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-n1vGeVIXo (but actually pronounces it right)
